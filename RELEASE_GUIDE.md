# GitHub Release Guide

This guide explains how to create a GitHub release and upload the Windows executable.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account with access to the repository
- Built executable file: `dist/Soaring-CUP-Editor.exe`
- Repository pushed to GitHub

## Steps to Create a Release

### 1. Build the Executable

First, make sure you have a fresh build:

```powershell
# Clean previous builds
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build, dist -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Build the executable
python build_exe.py
# OR
build.bat

# Verify the executable exists
Test-Path dist\Soaring-CUP-Editor.exe
```

The executable will be in `dist/Soaring-CUP-Editor.exe` (approximately 15-20 MB).

### 2. Test the Executable

**Important:** Test the executable before releasing!

```powershell
# Run from dist folder
cd dist
.\Soaring-CUP-Editor.exe

# Test these features:
# - Opens without errors
# - Loads a CUP file
# - Adds/edits a waypoint
# - Saves a file
# - All tabs work in dialog
# - Unit dropdowns work
```

Create `RELEASE_NOTES.md` first with the description from above.

### 4. Verify the Release

1. **Go to releases page:**
   ```
   https://github.com/ebialobrzeski/cup_waypoint_editor/releases
   ```

2. **Check that:**
   - ‚úÖ Release is marked as "Latest"
   - ‚úÖ Version tag is correct (v3.0.0)
   - ‚úÖ Executable is attached as an asset
   - ‚úÖ Description displays correctly
   - ‚úÖ Download link works

3. **Test download:**
   - Click on the executable asset
   - Download to a test location
   - Run to verify it works

## Version Numbering

Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Major version** (v3.0.0): Breaking changes, major new features
- **Minor version** (v3.1.0): New features, backward compatible
- **Patch version** (v3.0.1): Bug fixes only

Examples:
- `v3.0.0` - Complete CUP specification compliance (current)
- `v3.1.0` - Future: Add map integration feature
- `v3.0.1` - Future: Fix a bug in elevation fetching

## Release Checklist

Before creating a release:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated (README.md)
- [ ] Changelog updated
- [ ] Version number bumped in `__init__.py`
- [ ] Clean build created
- [ ] Executable tested on clean Windows system
- [ ] Git committed and pushed to main branch
- [ ] Git tag created locally: `git tag v3.0.0`
- [ ] Git tag pushed: `git push origin v3.0.0`

## Updating an Existing Release

If you need to fix a release:

1. **Edit the release:**
   - Go to releases page
   - Click "Edit" button (pencil icon)
   - Update description or title

2. **Replace executable:**
   - Delete old asset (click X)
   - Upload new executable
   - Click "Update release"

## Best Practices

### File Naming
- ‚úÖ Good: `Soaring-CUP-Editor.exe`
- ‚ùå Bad: `editor.exe`, `setup.exe`, `app_v3.exe`

### Release Notes
- Always include what's new
- List breaking changes prominently
- Include system requirements
- Add screenshots if UI changed
- Link to documentation

### Frequency
- Don't release too often (confuses users)
- Group related fixes into one release
- Major features deserve their own release

### Pre-releases
For testing before official release:
- Create release as usual
- Check ‚òëÔ∏è **"Set as a pre-release"**
- Tag as `v3.0.0-beta.1` or `v3.0.0-rc.1`

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Failed
- Check file size (must be < 2 GB)
- Check internet connection
- Try again in a few minutes

### Can't Create Tag
```powershell
# Check existing tags
git tag -l

# Delete tag if it exists
git tag -d v3.0.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v3.0.0

# Create new tag
git tag v3.0.0
git push origin v3.0.0
```

### Wrong Version Number
- Edit the release
- Change the tag version
- Or delete release and recreate
